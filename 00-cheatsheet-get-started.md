# Configure git

Git was initially created for the linux kernel which operates entirely on mailing lists, so
commits are intended to work well with email.

Use the following commands to configure git with your name and email. These will be viewable
by other people with access to your repository on every commit you make.

```
git config --global user.name "Nathan West"
git config --global user.email "nathan@quadrature.dev"
```
